# Journey through PWK – Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough (Enumerate)

Wrapping up week 3, things are slowing down a bit as the sections are covering
information I am not as well practiced in. My goals at this point are no longer
oriented towards getting through X sections but grasping the material I have not
encountered before.

This week was all about gathering information. I love this part of penetration
testing because the more you know about your target the more you are going to be
able to use when getting to the exploitation phase. I cannot stress how
important gathering information is because if you get stuck you can always go
back to your notes from information gathering and the answer very well could be
there.

This past week has been a deep dive into enumeration which is all about nailing
down a methodology as well as picking the tools you want to use that will aid
you in the quest for knowledge about a target. I did a bit more work in passive
information gathering, or OSINT, on a company for some additional practice, I
spent time gathering information on their subdomains, email addresses,
organizational charts, and the technologies they use. This was all accomplished
using Google searches, theharvester, and recon-ng.

Into active information gathering where I targeted the site build for PWK. I was
a little rusty on the tools section but knew the methodology. It has been a
while since I have done any DNS enumeration so I took my time working with the
host command and scripting forward and reverse look ups as well as a zone
transfer. To prepare for situations where a zone transfer might not be possible,
I started a list of prefixes to do forward looks up on as a baseline.
Network Scanning

Scanning a network for what hosts are up, what ports those hosts have open, and
what is running on those ports is invaluable information, but it can take some
nmap to speed that process up and gather as much information I can. Using nmap
to identify which hosts are up, what ports are open, what is running on those
ports, what version those services are, and what kind of device they’re running
on. All those pieces of information are critical to the success of a penetration
test.
