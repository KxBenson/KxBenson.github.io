# Journey through PWK â€“ Simple Review and a Deadly Python

Personal life happened and stifled my progress a bit for PWK. This is going to
be a somewhat short post as the content covered was fairly introductory. I will
list some resources at the end of the post that I have used in the past that
allowed me to move through this part of class quickly.

I made it through all of the content for sections 1-3 of PWK aside from a few
exercises at this point. Overall I am feeling fairly confident in my abilities
in these areas based upon what was covered in the course.

Netcat and Wireshark are both tools I am fairly comfortable and familiar with.
Wireshark is a tool I often have to use when analyzing network traffic for
network security and digital forensics work although I do prefer tcpdump until
I get traffic down to a manageable size that wont make Wireshark fall over.
Netcat on the other hand was a large part of successfully earning my GPEN.   

The main place I am finding myself weak is working with Python to creating
scripts outside of bash. I was tasked with creating some network scanning
utilities using bash and higher level scripting language. I had a small break
through last night after finding a post that utilized import ipaddress to do
network related tasks but still have to finish it up and test it. Once it is
done I will gladly share it!

Passive information gathering, or open source intelligence gathering (OSINT),
was fairly straight forward and something I find to be enjoyable. I have done a
fair amount of it related to people and as well as my organization. I do think
it would be useful to find a way to automate this a part either by creating
something or using a tool that already exists.

I am hopefully to push through some more in the next 7 days as life should
slow down a bit.
